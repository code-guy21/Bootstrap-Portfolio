					<p>
						My name is Alexis San Javier. I was born in Mexico but I have
						lived in the USA, and specifically Florida, for most of my life.
					</p>

					<p>
						I grew up in Lakeland and after graduating from High School, I
						went on to attend the University of Central Florida. In 2017 I
						graduated with my BS in computer engineering, and after
						graduation, I worked as a research technician, and as an
						instructor at an after school academy teaching children how to
						program micro-controllers.
					</p>

					<p>
						As of recent I took a hiatus and have been contemplating my next
						career move. I have been experimenting with web apps and as a
						result, my interest in this area has grown. So to solidify and
						expand my skill in this area I have enrolled in a full-stack
						Bootcamp at The University of Central Florida. With this
						experience, I hope to start a new chapter in my career.
